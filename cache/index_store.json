Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting\nFY 2022 -- UPDATED April 1, 2022\n(October 1, 2021 - September 30, 2022)\nNarrative changes appear in bold text\nItems underlined have been moved within the guidelines since the FY 2021 version\nItalics are used to indicate revisions to heading changes\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS), two departments within the U.S.Federal Government’s Department of Health\nand Human Services (DHHS) provide the following guidelines for coding and reporting using the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).These\nguidelines should be used as a companion document to the official version of the ICD-10-CM as\npublished on the NCHS website.The ICD-10-CM is a morbidity classification published by the\nUnited States for classifying diagnoses and reason for visits in all health care settings.The ICD-\n10-CM is based on the ICD-10, the statistical classification of disease published by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO).These guidelines have been approved by the four organizations that make up the Cooperating\nParties for the ICD-10-CM: the American Hospital Association (AHA), the American Health\nInformation Management Association (AHIMA), CMS, and NCHS.These guidelines are a set of rules that have been developed to accompany and complement the\nofficial conventions and instructions provided within the ICD-10-CM itself.The instructions and\nconventions of the classification take precedence over guidelines.These guidelines are based on\nthe coding and sequencing instructions in the Tabular List and Alphabetic Index of ICD-10-CM,\nbut provide additional instruction.Adherence to these guidelines when assigning ICD-10-CM\ndiagnosis codes is required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n(HIPAA).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VEq5r/6B4HDVBiuoNyMg+UPgRsBcPJwDUmxBZ5s+458="},"e2ef5fc7-f2ef-4870-b288-a28c66ddba36":{"id_":"e2ef5fc7-f2ef-4870-b288-a28c66ddba36","metadata":{"page_number":1,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"I4zKPmJvv4PuQHhBcqgPiBxmsiQw9GrFPKEzKm9YE3A="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"76b79b6e-02c6-4700-8a5b-0eaaef32d09c","metadata":{"page_number":1,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"VEq5r/6B4HDVBiuoNyMg+UPgRsBcPJwDUmxBZ5s+458="}},"text":"The diagnosis codes (Tabular List and Alphabetic Index) have been adopted under\nHIPAA for all healthcare settings.A joint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is\nessential to achieve complete and accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of\ndiagnoses and procedures.These guidelines have been developed to assist both the healthcare\nprovider and the coder in identifying those diagnoses that are to be reported.The importance of\nconsistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized.Without\nsuch documentation accurate coding cannot be achieved.The entire record should be reviewed to\ndetermine the specific reason for the encounter and the conditions treated.The term encounter is used for all settings, including hospital admissions.In the context of these\nguidelines, the term provider is used throughout the guidelines to mean physician or any qualified\nhealth care practitioner who is legally accountable for establishing the patient’s diagnosis.Only\nthis set of guidelines, approved by the Cooperating Parties, is official.The guidelines are organized into sections.Section I includes the structure and conventions of the\nclassification and general guidelines that apply to the entire classification, and chapter-specific\nguidelines that correspond to the chapters as they are arranged in the classification.Section II\nincludes guidelines for selection of principal diagnosis for non-outpatient settings.Section III\nincludes guidelines for reporting additional diagnoses in non-outpatient settings.Section IV is for\noutpatient coding and reporting.It is necessary to review all sections of the guidelines to fully\nunderstand all of the rules and instructions needed to code properly.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cDuHjCT/LRj8CQUdLn1E5nsNIdNYiiV4gFCQn/spbyc="},"faec6177-d02b-42ac-b61f-552af10810d1":{"id_":"faec6177-d02b-42ac-b61f-552af10810d1","metadata":{"page_number":2,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Y6DARXjxajb5g6pS9pzpXy4TpWLfyAiB84lqBthUqnY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f216a92f-557d-43da-bcbb-3e8895a4dbeb","metadata":{},"hash":"yyLj/mzORpJavuZRZv7J2LQgjqo1sSVWOXhBZSpiucQ="}},"text":"ICD-10-CM

reason for the encounter and the conditions treated.If a definitive diagnosis has not been established by the end of the encounter, it is\nappropriate to report codes for sign(s) and/or symptom(s) in lieu of a definitive\ndiagnosis.When sufficient clinical information isn’t known or available about a\nparticular health condition to assign a more specific code, it is acceptable to report the\nappropriate “unspecified” code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined,\nbut not the specific type).Unspecified codes should be reported when they are the codes\nthat most accurately reflect what is known about the patient’s condition at the time of\nthat particular encounter.It would be inappropriate to select a specific code that is not\nsupported by the medical record documentation or conduct medically unnecessary\ndiagnostic testing in order to determine a more specific

Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting\nFY 2022\nPage 83 of 115\nThere is no national requirement for mandatory ICD-10-CM external cause code\nreporting.Unless a provider is subject to a state-based external cause code reporting\nmandate or these codes are required by a particular payer, reporting of ICD-10-CM\ncodes in Chapter 20, External Causes of Morbidity, is not required.In the absence of a\nmandatory reporting requirement, providers are encouraged to voluntarily report\nexternal cause codes, as they provide valuable data for injury research and evaluation of\ninjury prevention strategies.a.General External Cause Coding Guidelines\n1) Used with any code in the range of A00.0-T88.9, Z00-Z99\nAn external cause code may be used with any code in the range of\nA00.0-T88.9, Z00-Z99, classification that represents a health condition\ndue to an external cause.Though they are most applicable to injuries,\nthey are also valid for use with such things as infections or diseases due\nto an external source, and other health conditions, such as a heart attack\nthat occurs during strenuous physical activity.2) External cause code used for length of treatment\nAssign the external cause code, with the appropriate 7 th character (initial\nencounter, subsequent encounter or sequela) for each encounter for\nwhich the injury or condition is being treated.Most categories in chapter 20 have a 7 th character requirement for each\napplicable code.Most categories in this chapter have three 7 th character\nvalues: A, initial encounter, D, subsequent encounter and S, sequela.While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the\ncourse of treatment for an injury or condition, assignment of the 7 th\ncharacter for external cause should match the 7 th character of the code\nassigned for the associated injury or condition for the encounter.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qre91EFE9jS0BoMUPdUB/xuhll2V4kAyzAJ9wjH3j+c="},"86ca891a-1f10-400e-8500-cda62d36aded":{"id_":"86ca891a-1f10-400e-8500-cda62d36aded","metadata":{"page_number":83,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf_83","metadata":{"page_number":83,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"LKTryBDRunc4Cnk3efNTZLXTsq5SO12H0WHU/H4v1f8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"361fc698-7265-4c97-b8ca-dc3c41524cde","metadata":{"page_number":83,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"qre91EFE9jS0BoMUPdUB/xuhll2V4kAyzAJ9wjH3j+c="}},"text":"3)

procedure codes.A corresponding procedure code must\naccompany a Z code to describe any procedure performed.c.Categories of Z Codes\n1) Contact/Exposure\nCategory Z20 indicates contact with, and suspected exposure to,\ncommunicable diseases.These codes are for patients who are suspected\nto have been exposed to a disease by close personal contact with an\ninfected individual or are in an area where a disease is epidemic.Category Z77, Other contact with and (suspected) exposures hazardous\nto health, indicates contact with and suspected exposures hazardous to\nhealth.Contact/exposure codes may be used as a first-listed code to explain an\nencounter for testing, or, more commonly, as a secondary code to\nidentify a potential risk.2) Inoculations and vaccinations\nCode Z23 is for encounters for inoculations and vaccinations.It indicates\nthat a patient is being seen to receive a prophylactic inoculation against a\ndisease.Procedure codes are required to identify the actual\nadministration of the injection and the type(s) of immunizations given.Code Z23 may be used as a secondary code if the inoculation is given as\na routine part of preventive health care, such as a well-baby visit.3) Status\nStatus codes indicate that a patient is either a carrier of a disease or has\nthe sequelae or residual of a past disease or condition.This includes such\nthings as the presence of prosthetic or mechanical devices resulting from\npast treatment.A status code is informative, because the status may\naffect the course of treatment and its outcome.A status code is distinct\nfrom a history code.The history code indicates that the patient no longer\nhas the condition.A status code should not be used with a diagnosis code from one of the\nbody system chapters, if the diagnosis code includes the information\nprovided by the status code.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5WxjKYmNu2vT3e/em5wwciFyL9f5syvHNLURq9vSXzo="},"a2dc3094-90bd-4412-8c5d-e7f117df99f9":{"id_":"a2dc3094-90bd-4412-8c5d-e7f117df99f9","metadata":{"page_number":88,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf_88","metadata":{"page_number":88,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"19GecXB3Et72tysXirIKxaQCviGy3ZGWHXeC6gAmjd4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4c5714db-6e72-434d-a142-085f625db0a2","metadata":{"page_number":88,"total_pages":115,"file_path":"C:\\perso\\AI\\Udemy\\usps_pdf\\usps_pdf\\data\\10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","file_name":"10-ICM_guidelines-FY2022-April.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"5WxjKYmNu2vT3e/em5wwciFyL9f5syvHNLURq9vSXzo="}},"text":"For

excluded.”UHDDS\ndefinitions apply to inpatients in acute care, short-term, long term care and psychiatric hospital setting.The\nUHDDS definitions are used by acute care short-term hospitals to report inpatient data elements in a\nstandardized manner.These data elements and their definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985, Federal\nRegister (Vol.50, No, 147),

Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting\nFY 2022\nPage 105 of 115\nSince that time, the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded to include all non-outpatient\nsettings (acute care, short term, long term care and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab\nfacilities; nursing homes, etc.).The UHDDS definitions also apply to hospice services (all levels of care).The following guidelines are to be applied in designating “other diagnoses” when neither the Alphabetic\nIndex nor the Tabular List in ICD-10-CM provide direction.The listing of the diagnoses in the patient\nrecord is the responsibility of the attending provider.A.Previous conditions\nIf the provider has included a diagnosis in the final diagnostic statement, such as the discharge\nsummary or the face sheet, it should ordinarily be coded.Some providers include in the\ndiagnostic statement resolved conditions or diagnoses and status-post procedures from previous\nadmissions that have no bearing on the current stay.Such conditions are not to be reported and\nare coded only if required by hospital policy.However, history codes (categories Z80-Z87) may be used as secondary codes if the historical\ncondition or family history has an impact on current care or influences treatment.B.Abnormal findings\nAbnormal findings (laboratory, x-ray, pathologic, and other diagnostic results) are not coded\nand reported unless the provider indicates their clinical significance.If the findings are outside\nthe normal range and the attending provider has ordered other tests to evaluate the condition or\nprescribed treatment, it is appropriate to ask the provider whether the abnormal finding should\nbe added.Please note: This differs from the coding practices in the outpatient setting
